I am a Python and Javascript Developer and a Computer Science Junior in <a href="http://www.msit.in">Maharaja Institute of Technology</a>.

My current interests involve Front-End Development and Deep Learning.

I write these blogs whenever I get some spare time and also when I have something interesting to show you guys!
